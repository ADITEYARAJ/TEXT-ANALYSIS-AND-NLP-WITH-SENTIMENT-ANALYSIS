"1","Had an old Dell Desktop before this. Served me well for nearly 11 years with frequent hardware & software updates. Computer Upgrade time and I'm left wondering what's the big hype with Apple and whether they are worth the premium over other brands. After using this MacBook for a decent period of time and putting it through its paces, I'm doing this Review. Lets get on with it then:PROS:1) BUILD QUALITY: Simply superb. Seriously. This thing is built to perfection, the lightweight aluminium body, the sleek design, the total lack of heat vents and speaker ports, the pressure sensitive glass touchpad, everything is so neat and clean. This is just classy! And thin, like ultra thin. Weighs about 1.5 kg. Comes with a nice robust Chiclet keyboard. That lovely Apple logo on the back. And the brilliant backlit keys on the full size keyboard. Nice touch that ! Even the charging port has a nice orange/green LED and a quick disconnect feature (MagSafe 2) should you trip over the wires. So its well built then.2) MAC OS SIERRA: I've been using MS Windows right from its XP days right up till the latest OS Windows 10. So I was very skeptical of this Mac OS. Something new and complicated maybe? But, and trust me when I say this,  it is so much better now that I am familiar with it. Give yourself a couple of days or a week at most, you will wonder what made you hang around with MS Windows for so long. This is just so easy to navigate, so user friendly and so fast.3) SCREEN: Though I read lots of gripes about the screen before buying this, I personally find the screen absolutely brilliant. No complaints on the display or brightness aspect. Maybe a full HD or 4K or Retina display might be better specs wise but seriously who can tell the difference that easily? Unless you're watching or dealing with those High-Res images or Videos regularly. At 13.3 inches, it is the perfect size combining good displaying area and portability. And yes it has an Auto-dimming feature which works well in conjunction with the back-lit keyboard. Nice battery saving feature.4) BATTERY LIFE: So, I approached the 12 Hr battery life (Claimed) with some degree of apprehension as just a Tall Claim. But, when Apple claims 12 Hrs, they really mean 12 Hrs. I regularly get 10-15 hrs on a single charge, with a mix of youtube/video sites (5-6hrs), data /office work (5-6 hrs) and e-mails (2-3 hrs) on a DAILY basis. The battery level drops so slowly it is just great. This with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth always on and screen at about 60% Brilliance.5) CONNECTIVITY:  Bluetooth (Ver 4.0), Wi-Fi, 2 USB (Ver 3.0) ports, ThunderBolt 2 port, SDXC Card slot, is more than enough for normal usage and connectivity.6) SPECS & SPEED: This laptop is really fast. Apps open super quick, load times on webpages are really fast and the computer never hangs or lags even when multitasking with multiple apps open and downloads streaming. And this is with a 1.6Ghz processor (Turbo Boost upto 2.7Ghz), 8GB Ram, 128GB SSD. Everything is optimised to work with the Hardware available and it does a good job of it.7) CAMERA: Front facing 720p camera is just about OK for the task at hand. For normal Skype calls/Face-time Video calls it fares OK but if you plan on showing someone Detailed Scenery or Panoramic views of your surroundings, then it falls short in capturing vivid details.8) APPS PRE-LOADED: Movie,Garageband,Pages,Numbers,Keynote,Safari,Mail,Messages,FaceTime,Calendar,Contacts,AppStore,iTunes,iBooks,Maps,Photo Booth,Time Machine. These cover nearly most if not all requirements of a normal day-to-day user for entertainment and productivity.9) DUAL OS: Yes since late 2016 Apple has given users the liberty to officially Download & run a dual OS (Windows) and Mac on its range of MacBooks. Which I have done. Does it work and run Normally? Yes it does, just Brilliantly! Follow the instructions on the Apple site for how to get it to work.CONS:1) I imagine it will be the price. But I'm a firm believer in &#34;You get what you pay for&#34; so I wouldn't really grumble too much on that. Though the price has gone up a bit since I bought it a month ago at 54990/-2) Lack of user upgradable options maybe? Again,not a deal breaker. These specs and build quality should last quite a while.3) Face time camera is not very crisp, could do with better resolution.4) All connections go dead when the screen is shut. So you cannot download or stream in the background unless the laptop is open. There is an App workaround for this but no setting built into the Laptop by default.**Note** The Windows version (Win 10) is only a Certified Genuine Version of Windows. A separate License/Registration key needs to be purchase separately to get regular Updates. Otherwise the Windows version is fully Functional.***Note*** Due to some connectivity issues/driver support for other Hardware (Printer Scanner etc) I needed to run Windows for support. So, I now have Windows 10 and Mac OS Sierra running together on the same MacBook Air. Best of both worlds. How Awesome is that !! But yes my default is still the MacOS. Windows is beginning to look kind of boring now.MacBook Air - June 2017 Update:From Mid-June 2017 onwards, the MacBook Air comes with a 1.8 Ghz processor. Every other detail remains the same as before spec-for-spec. Thats a 0.2 Ghz jump over the 1.6 Ghz model. Nothing else changed!VERDICT: Highly recommended. This is seriously good stuff and well worth the premium over other brands. If you are in the market for a Quality premium Laptop and have the budget, then go for this! You won't regret it. Running Windows 10 & Mac OS together...thats just the cherry on the cake!Hope this Review has been Helpful to you. Tks & Happy Shopping!

"2","You can scroll down straight away to the review but if you want to know the thought process behind switching to Mac from Windows then you can read on.I was a Windows user up until 2016 and used it for nearly 7 years. So when I decided to finally change my laptop, I started searching for best available options. I have heard a lot about MacBooks up until then but didn't want to shift as its a costly deal to own an Apple product. Back then  in 2000s, I was a student so couldn't really afford it. So I waited until the right moment and finally decided to switch to Mac OS and its entry level product which is 13.3 inch MacBook Air 8GB RAM 128GB SSD variant.Before ordering, I watched as many videos as possible to learn about Mac OS. There were lots of new features and an entirely different approach to do stuff on your computer. Finally gave order on 17th October 2016. Its been almost 2 years since I got this product and its still working great. Following are the Pros and Cons. Its not a debate over Mac Vs Windows. Both are completely different products, so you cant really compare the two.Pros.1. Great piece of hardware. Built quality is exceptional. You get your every penny worth.2. Very lightweight. Yet feels sturdy at the same time. Doesn't feel like parts will be falling out in coming years.3. Extremely great battery life. Considering the size, the battery backup is phenomenal. At the beginning, I got almost 10 hours of battery backup.  After 2 years of usage, I am still getting 8 hours of battery backup which easily lasts through entire office session at work place.4. The charger's magsafe technology is awesome. I think every laptop should have this to avoid tipping your laptop over table because you snapped  at the cable while moving. It keeps laptop safe during those accidental conditions.5. Keyboard is joy to type on. Key travel is much more relaxing so you can type for hours and don't feel fatigued.6. Trackpad is simply the best on this device. Even windows laptop at this price point can't give you the similar experience. It's buttery smooth and  touch sensitivity is great. Its multi touch gestures almost acts like you are using a smartphone.7. There are plenty of ports for your essentials which nowadays a rarity. 2 USB ports, a headphone jack (yay!), SD card reader (double yay!). We still  haven't moved on to USB C completely in this dongle era so having this laptop still makes sense. External hard discs work like breeze. You need to format them before use if you are switching from Windows. It's a bit of hassle. But once you are done, you don't need to look back again.8. Mac OS works great. It's very smooth even after 2 years of use. You will get used to it pretty soon. For first month or so, you will miss Windows as  you are used to it. But after learning curve passes, you will be good to go.Cons.1. It's not upgradable. The RAM and storage can't be upgraded. Might be a big deal for someone. But for a regular user, current specs are more  than enough. For office use its perfect. I also use photo editing software on it which works better with good speeds. 8 GB RAM is sufficient and storage problem can be solved by external hard disc.2. Though the built quality is exceptional, because of metallic design, its easily scratch-able. So you need to put on a hard shell case or use a sleeve  to store it.3. No HDMI. There is no direct HDMI port so you need to get a dongle. Apple one will be costly but there will be other options available. For me it  doesn't really matter as I don't use it for PPT presentations or anything HDMI related.4. Screen Resolution- It's not the best screen when you are paying this much amount for a laptop. But there had to be some sacrifices while making  this thin machine and all other specs. If you are a media freak and use the laptop for photo or video editing, this one is not for you. For regular usage, the screen is sufficient. I hope they bring new MacBook Air models with Retina display which I think won't happen after seeing their new MacBook line ups.I think that sums it up. If you can live with these cons and moving to different operating system then this product will be good for you. At the end, it's just another product. You can get used to it or can always get back to Windows. I think at least once, you should own a MacBook just to complete your experience. It will be worth it.                                                       P.when('review-image-binder', 'reviewsLightbox-js').execute(function(reviewImageBinder) {             reviewImageBinder.bindReview(""ROR1TIINQKERC"",                 ""ROR1TIINQKERC_imageSection_main"",                 ""ROR1TIINQKERC_gallerySection_main"");         });"
"3","It is excellent in most of the parameters but main board died suddenly without any sign of distress ( night we shutdown and in the morning it was not booting completely died)It costed 46k to onsiteGo (as they declared) and rs 1700 to us at apple authorised service center for diagnosis.If reliability improved it is the master piece.The above is not stray incidence as many complaints are there on internetUpdate 25.07.2019Again it stopped booting, now there is no warranty, taken to multi lap top service center they repaired by  introcing some fine cables from one chip to another and billed 16k (further they informed me tha the on-siteGo didn't replace mother board but repaired contrary to their claim), but I was not confident. hence I have  exchanged it with lenovo and got an Exhange value of 13k"
"4","I understand why MacBooks are the best in quality. It has been 2.6 years so far. Due to indian climate (high humidity), it did give me trouble after a year. Motherboard shutdown. Luckily I had warranty at that time. So got my entire motherboard replaced. It is worth to extend your warranty (Apple iCare) directly from a store. So far since the replacement, it has been running smoothly. Speed is awesome, battery life is great too. The charger died last month and I had to get a new one. Ofcourse given it’s an Apple product, we know the chargers aren’t so good. I used Asus before this for almost 5 years before this. Let’s see how long my Mac will last. I will review after 2-3 years and update."
"5","This is My first high-value purchase from Amazon India. Amazing and fulfilled all the expectations.Pros:-6-8 hours batteryVey light weight.Design is fabulouscharger look's GoodMac OS XTrack pad  ( Very smoothly )Cons :-128 GB storage"

"8","Apple Macbook air 13 is best in its class. I was hesitant switching from Windows to Macbook, but as I made my mind and purchased Macbook air it is simply waao.. U don't need any compatibility as its loaded with all the features where you can work creatively.. Preinstalled apps like,  iMovie, keynote, pages, makes your work easier.. Whether it's for business or students this laptop surely works with wonders.Pros-Slim design,  metal body,  classy premium look,  excellent battery backup, loaded feature,  fast reboot, fast charging, multipurpose track pad and many moreCons-Need to find someM simply loving it u should also go for it                                                       P.when('review-image-binder', 'reviewsLightbox-js').execute(function(reviewImageBinder) {             reviewImageBinder.bindReview(""R3GEVIR97ZAYKH"",                 ""R3GEVIR97ZAYKH_imageSection_main"",                 ""R3GEVIR97ZAYKH_gallerySection_main"");         });"
"9","It is the best thing I have ever bought!! Its been months I have purchased MacBook Air but I am still not done with the thrill of having it.-Getting up to 11.5 hours battery back up!-Works so smooth. No delay. Super fast.-Super portable. I literally carry it with 24/7.-Acad, Photoshop, Sketch up and other regular softwares works perfects on the go. Movie, browsing, sharing experiences are insane as well.-Absolutely no compatibility issues as I do continuously switch from Windows to apple and back like all the time, which I was always worried about before buying."
"10","Me and 5 of my friends bought MAC Book air in 2017.All of us have sudden problem with keyboard. Some have power button issues and others have few keys malfunctioning. And it happens in a span of a week . Now when one of my friend went to service store they asked 30000 to fix it . MAC was supposed to be fast light in weight and durable . But it failed doing so .

"11","I am using this laptop for 2.5yr. Still didn't face any issue. Till now battery backup is extremely satisfying.Those who are fond of programming and use any IDE like Android studio or eclipse, this is the one for them for not so high price.Cons.1. There is no Ethernet port which create some problem while using the laptop for configuring any device like Telecom MUX ect.2. As we are all habituated with MS Office, even though apple has it's own office, it doesn't impress you at all. Remedy, you can buy genuine office from Microsoft or you can use open office here."
"12","Almost an year now. Works perfectly well, easily manages Photoshop and Premiere Pro without any lags. Ultra light and best trackpad I've ever came across over years!"
"13","Apple. My last product i will ever buy. No apples for me now. Uaing it for 3 years and the display has gone to visit the Mt. Everest. Never had problems with any of the laptops bfr."
"14","Within one year my Mac book air wodn't turn on, then I want Mac book service center they said water damaged we can't cover your laptop in warranty period . They asked me 50k INR I said give me my laptop back then after some days I tried some online commands I it's start working ... So way they asked me 50k I don't know . Now after two years it's again not working.

"15","Awesome Product.Battery is amazing in just within 2hours it charges upto around 90℅. For around 10hours it was in wifi just downloading couple of movies, after 10 hours the battery was still 21℅.Amazing performance... very slim and sleek.Little pricey but you will not regret it."
"16","I bought this in Feb-17 and this was not my daily driver. I was using this for casual surfing, media, etc. I guess, I haven't used this for more than 1000 hours (2-3 months) as well. Single handed use, very careful, no travelling at all.I bought this aiming that I won't have to worry for next 5-6 years at least. Apple is fooling and looting people. Even the inspection charges are around Rs. 2-3K, in which they will just diagnose it. No repair will be done."
"17","Good quality but had issues in laptop when was out of warranty period. So it's recommended to for extended warranty but it will cost you additional 18k. So calculate your budget accordingly."
"18","Its a delight to work on. Coming from a X owner of Surface it means something.Pros - Light, Herculean Battery Life , Great performance , will pretty much juggle whatever you throw at it.Con - Display could have been crisp, Comes without a pouch or bagMac is loved for a reason & Air is just amazing. Its sleekness will draw immediate attention"
"19","Been working solidly for more than 3 years now, absolutely no complaints whatsoever so far. I've since purchased an iPad too, and trust me when I say, Apple products are a world apart."
"20","Awesome laptop even gaming is also good i am playing WOT it works perfectly.battery is great giving 6hrs got it at 57000® at sale 👍"
"21","I bought it during GST time at 55k. now I m a fan of apple. though it's not convenient for Sanskrit or Devanagari. I am still using windows in mac. so I get the advantages of mac machine and ease of windows.I must suggest buying the hardcover for the same"
"22","I have purchased Apple Imac from Amazon last year. My Imac is having a problem and While trying to check the validity of the Warranty, Apple Website shows the serial number of the delivered item is not valid. Refer attached screenshot.

"23","It is not as good as the one you buy from Physical store but still it is better than other Brands. I purchase one from Physical Shop and one from Amazon, the one with Amazon has less Battery Back up than the other else other part is fine."
"24","A very beautiful and a great product, no doubts there. Very fast and very appealing crisp display. Battery works for 7 to 8 hours and not 12 hours as indicated. Big dampener is that, after a point of angle, the screen falls back on its own to the end point of swivel allowed for the screen. Not good for a premium product."
"25","Good product, just like any apple. Made to last and high quality. Maybe the only thing i would want is for them to have a higher spec currently i5 intel core processor from 2015, should have the latest ones as well."

"34","Don't buy this one, that display will hurt you eyes"
"35","A cool laptop with awesome battery backup and sleek design. Processing power is a plus point but when it comes to storage you need to be choosy on the files you want to store. The 5gb free cloud storage is expandable through a yearly subscription (paid)."
"36","Awesome Product.. Awesome speakers.. super light weight.. perfect for web streaming and media streaming... super portable and awesome built quality.. got the product at amazon for merely 55000/- which is super cheap.. good value for money.. super recommend this product"
"37","it's kind of enchanted if we talks of look and design  as far as performance is concerned it's a heads down over my old 12&#34; macbook even though at 1.2 ghz but could manage to run around 13 hours after single charge which is cool and makes it go to use as portable mac!!!"
"38","I bought this item on last year June. I never do heavy use of this laptop as weekly 3 times I use it. Paying such huge amount for online purchase, I see horizontal lines on the laptop screen when I try to shutdown. I really feel sad that Amazon sell such third grade product online."
"39","If you a developer and thinking whether it is worth buying it, I suggest you to go for it. It can seamlessly handle Android Studio, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator along with tons of  tabs open in Chrome 😍😍"

"47","Hardware issue after a year of very minimal usage. Checked in iStore and they said the logic board has to be replaced for a cost that's almost close to a new MacBook Air. So buyers be aware..!!"
