"Reviewed in India on 8 February 2018"
"Got this at a price of RS 6999. Now at this price it's the best option for me.Overall a good phone but battery backup is bit disappointing. Phone do heat up when you play games or watch online videos for a long time but then it's normal for every phone. Charging time is around 2.30 hours but interesting fact is you will get around 60-65 % charge in 60 min.Camera is good and you can also record slow motion videos.If any questions about this phone.. comment here"

"Reviewed in India on 8 February 2018"
"Got this at a price of RS 6999. Now at this price it's the best option for me.Overall a good phone but battery backup is bit disappointing. Phone do heat up when you play games or watch online videos for a long time but then it's normal for every phone. Charging time is around 2.30 hours but interesting fact is you will get around 60-65 % charge in 60 min.Camera is good and you can also record slow motion videos.If any questions about this phone.. comment here"

"Reviewed in India on 8 February 2018"
"Got this at a price of RS 6999. Now at this price it's the best option for me.Overall a good phone but battery backup is bit disappointing. Phone do heat up when you play games or watch online videos for a long time but then it's normal for every phone. Charging time is around 2.30 hours but interesting fact is you will get around 60-65 % charge in 60 min.Camera is good and you can also record slow motion videos.If any questions about this phone.. comment here"

"Best deal for me ."
"Reviewed in India on 8 February 2018"
"Got this at a price of RS 6999. Now at this price it's the best option for me.Overall a good phone but battery backup is bit disappointing. Phone do heat up when you play games or watch online videos for a long time but then it's normal for every phone. Charging time is around 2.30 hours but interesting fact is you will get around 60-65 % charge in 60 min.Camera is good and you can also record slow motion videos.If any questions about this phone.. comment here"

"Best deal for me ."
"Reviewed in India on 8 February 2018"
"Got this at a price of RS 6999. Now at this price it's the best option for me.Overall a good phone but battery backup is bit disappointing. Phone do heat up when you play games or watch online videos for a long time but then it's normal for every phone. Charging time is around 2.30 hours but interesting fact is you will get around 60-65 % charge in 60 min.Camera is good and you can also record slow motion videos.If any questions about this phone.. comment here"

"Best deal for me ."
"Reviewed in India on 8 February 2018"
"Got this at a price of RS 6999. Now at this price it's the best option for me.Overall a good phone but battery backup is bit disappointing. Phone do heat up when you play games or watch online videos for a long time but then it's normal for every phone. Charging time is around 2.30 hours but interesting fact is you will get around 60-65 % charge in 60 min.Camera is good and you can also record slow motion videos.If any questions about this phone.. comment here"

"Best deal for me ."
"Reviewed in India on 8 February 2018"
"Got this at a price of RS 6999. Now at this price it's the best option for me.Overall a good phone but battery backup is bit disappointing. Phone do heat up when you play games or watch online videos for a long time but then it's normal for every phone. Charging time is around 2.30 hours but interesting fact is you will get around 60-65 % charge in 60 min.Camera is good and you can also record slow motion videos.If any questions about this phone.. comment here"
